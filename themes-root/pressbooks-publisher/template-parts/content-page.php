		<p><a href="http://www.pressbooks.com" target="_blank">Pressbooks</a> is an authoring platform built on <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> that allows teams to easily manage ebook content and quickly export it to several formats including ePub and PDF.</p>
		<p>The team at ODDI has set up an instance of Pressbooks and modified it to support the specific needs of BBG. Some of the issues we addressed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Streamlined user interface customized to the needs of BBG entities</li>
			<li>Improved language support by focusing on ePub3 format</li>
			<li>Simplified font embedding workflow for multilingual support</li>
			<li>Added support for in-language plus English book information for foreign language books</li>
			<li>Supported access to the mPDF rendering option for PDFs as an open-source, free alternative to Prince</li>
		</ul>
